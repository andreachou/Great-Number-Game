# Great Number Game

## Coding Dojo Practice 07.04.2022

<br/>

I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100...

![sample](./great_number_game.gif)

Create a site that allows a user to play this guessing game. Upon loading, the server should "pick" a random number between 1-100; store the number in session. Allow the user to guess the number--tell them when they are too high or too low. If they guess the correct number, notify them and offer to play again.

There are many different ways to do this assignment. When you finish the basic functionality, find a peer and compare your code!

In order to generate a random number you can use the ```random``` Python module:

```py
import random 	                # import the random module
random.randint(1, 100) 		# random number between 1-100
```


## **Step:**

* Create a new Flask project called great_number_game
* In the root route, save a random number between 1 and 100 and display a form for the user to guess the number
* Create a route that determines whether the number submitted is too high, too low, or correct. Show this status on the HTML page.
* NINJA BONUS: Display the results as shown in the wireframe above (i.e. with appropriate colors and positioning)
* NINJA BONUS: Allow the user to keep guessing until they get it correct
* NINJA BONUS: Let the user know how many attempts they took before guessing the correct number
* SENSEI BONUS: Only allow the user to guess up to 5 times. If they don't guess it on their 5th attempt, display a "You Lose" message and allow them to try again.
* SENSEI BONUS: If they win, allow the user to submit their name. Have a link to a leaderboard page that shows winners' names and how many attempts they took to guess correctly.
